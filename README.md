Welcome to the peg jump puzzle. The board starts out with a 
single blank position, represented by the '*'.  To make a 
move, select the letter of a peg.  A peg must be able to 
jump over an adjacent peg into a blank position for a move 
to be valid.  The jumped peg is then removed from the board. 
The game is over when there are no valid moves left. At any 
point enter '-' to exit, or '+' for instructions.
